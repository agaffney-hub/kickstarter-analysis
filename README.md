# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Project Overview: 
An analysis on the kickstarter campaigns from many countries and seeing the successes, failures and how many live campaigns are running to help Louise with her project; a play with a projected cost of $12,000.

## Analysis and Challenges: 
Some of the findings were that the top three campaign success categories were for theater, music, and film and video. ![ParentCategoryOutcomes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70240501/170381857-9944937f-e7de-4fbc-9e4e-5908f72ccde2.png)

Another finding was the campaigns that started in May were most successful and failed the most in July.

Some challenges that I encountered were how to reference filtered data from the Kickstarter original sheet. I struggled with how to pull that data in a filter within a function, but after a few videos, I was able to figure out the correct solution needed to make my cell work the way I wanted to.

## Results: 
Two conclusions from the Theater Outcomes versus Launch chart that I saw were that there were no canceled kickstarters in October, but there were more than double the amount of successful campaigns that launched in May. Another observation is that there were far more successful campaigns that asked for less than $1,000 or $30,000 to less than $40,000 and those were the only two goals that are consistently more successful than any other goals.
One limitation we have is not knowing the current performance status of the live campaigns, so our data can only go so far as to forecast.
Some other tables we could create based on the whole data is seeing what campaigns were able to get higher donations per contributor versus constant smaller contributions.
